      <section class="card" id="html-section">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is a lot like the walls of a house, it makes up the structure of the page</li>
          <li>If HTML is like the walls or structure of a house, each body is like a room partitioned out by walls</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS adds style to a webpage, can help make it more presentable</li>
          <li>If we continue the house analogy, then CSS is a lot like the paint and curtains of a house</li>
          <li>The "." in CSS is a class selector, but which the affected style changes all classes regardless of element</li>
          <li>CSS elements can simply be designated before the "{}" and the html will apply said style given the proper priority</li>
          <li>In order for the CSS to take effect, it needs to be linked in the html properly using both "rel:="stylesheet"" and "href="file-path""</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is used to submit, control and organize your work regarding well any code.</li>
          <li>The code "<b>git commit</b> -m" should never end like that, it always will need a note or it throws a mega tantrum</li>
          <li>Before ever using <b>git push</b> you should always use <b>git pull</b> origin main to ensure there are no conflicts</li>
          <li>A basic git flow will go:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>git status</b></li>
              <li><b>git add</b> -A</li>
              <li><b>git commit</b> -m "insert comment/summary"</li>
              <li><b>git pull</b> origin main</li>
              <li><b>git push</b> origin branchname</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JS | Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JS adds functionality, it allows for more than simple HTML interaction, it can add logic</li>
          <li>Again - continuing the House analogy, we can compare JS to appliances, as to add functionality and logic</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Control Flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The Control Flow typically executes from top to bottom of a command line</li>
          <li>An array is a collection of stored similar data, if a function cannot define an array for its behaviour, check the command flow (execute the command after the array is established)</li>
          <li>The function."name" line creates a an expected behaviour based on the logic given to it. When recalled by using "name"(); in a console, the fuction will be executed</li>
        </ul>
